module A {
  def x:int = 1
}

module B {
  module A {         // once B is resolved, this becomes the visible A, because we follow IMP,MOD, 
    def x:int = 1    // which shadows the LEX,MOD we use to get the outer A
  }
}

module C {
  def y:int = x
  import B
  import A
}

// interesting result here. importing B before A means the x reference resolves to x on line 2
// but importing A before B means the x reference resolves to x on line 7
