Questions:

How can scope graphs be represented in AGs?
- this is easy - just use reference attributes to make a graph.


How can scope graph resolution, and extension by import query
resolution, be implemented in AGs?

Does the demand-driven scheduling provide a solution to the scheduling
issues in Statix?
- do AGs "do better"?


Are reference collection attributes (as in JastAdd) useful?
- are they required? 
- or do they just let us write specs that look more like Statix?


Are circular attributes?
- is seems so ...




The list of lists of resolutions is wrong - it is a tree
